## This project is the front end of the web application of facebook.

### Made by: Tali Zikel, Aviya Megiddo Shaked, and Michal Magid.

### In this task, we were divided into subgroups.
### Tali made the app on Android (frontend), and the server (backend) of the whole program.
### Aviya and Michal made the web site (frontend).
### We preferred to divide the work in this way to optimize our time.
